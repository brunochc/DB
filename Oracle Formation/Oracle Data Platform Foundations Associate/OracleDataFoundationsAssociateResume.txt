    • Autonomous Database (ADB): A fully managed service where Oracle manages both the infrastructure and the database.
    • Co-managed Service (e.g., Database Cloud Services): Oracle manages the infrastructure, but the customer manages the database.
        ◦ Used for databases not yet on 19c or for packaged applications like E-Business Suite.
    • On-Premise: The customer manages everything, including infrastructure and the database.
1.2.2 The Business Case for Autonomous Database (ADB)
    • ADB offers a significantly lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).
    • Automation of tedious DBA tasks (best practices, configurations) reduces labor costs.
    • Wikibon Research Analysis: Running Oracle Database on Amazon RDS was found to be as expensive or 50% more expensive than on-premise, especially with Disaster Recovery.
    • In contrast, Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) costs were almost half that of on-premise.
1.2.3 Migrating to Autonomous Database
    • Migration Assessment: A tool is available to analyze an on-premise database and flag any unsupported features for ADB (e.g., pre-19c versions, tables in system schema).
    • Migration Process: The standard method uses Data Pump to export data from on-premise to the cloud object store, then import it into ADB.
    • Database Migration Service: A newer, automated service that handles the entire migration process from an on-premise or other cloud source to ADB.
    • Tuning: Existing tuning and indexes from on-premise databases can be preserved in ADB.
1.2.4 Application and Tool Certification
    • Packaged applications like JD Edwards, PeopleSoft, and Siebel are certified to run on ADB (E-Business Suite certification is upcoming).
    • A fully managed service is available to move the entire application stack (middle tier and database) to the cloud.

2. Converged Database


2.1 How to Simplify Application Development?
2.1.1 The Challenge of Modern Application Development
    • Modern enterprise applications must be data-driven, anticipating customer needs and creating value from data in real-time.
    • These applications operate on diverse data types (spatial, documents, sensor, transactional) pulled from multiple sources.
    • They create value through advanced analytics like:
        ◦ Machine Learning (e.g., for real-time recommendations, fraud detection)
        ◦ Graph Analytics (e.g., to identify influencers in a community)
        ◦ Spatial Data (e.g., to track deliveries)
    • Development uses modern paradigms (microservices, event processing, API-driven, low-code) and requires continuous delivery with zero downtime.
2.1.2 The Pitfalls of Single-Purpose Databases
    • Initially, single-purpose databases seem beneficial as they offer a convenient model for a new project.
    • However, this approach leads to significant problems:
        ◦ Data Fragmentation: Data is siloed across multiple databases.
        ◦ Increased Complexity: Mid-project changes often require combining data models (e.g., running analytics on a document store).
        ◦ Steep Learning Curve: Each database has its own proprietary APIs and languages, moving away from standard SQL.
        ◦ Vendor Lock-in: Proprietary APIs can lock an application to a specific database or cloud provider.
        ◦ Complex Application Code: Requires writing and maintaining code to propagate and sync data between different stores.
        ◦ Operational Overhead: Each database requires separate tuning, securing, scaling, troubleshooting, and patching, demanding specialized skills.
2.1.3 The Oracle Solution: The Converged Database
    • Oracle's solution is a converged database that eliminates data fragmentation by providing native support for all modern data types and models within a single database.
    • Key principles of the converged database:
        ◦ Native Support: Built-in support for all data types (e.g., Graph, JSON, Key Value) in one product.
        ◦ Engineered to Work Together: Different data types are engineered to work synergistically.
        ◦ Example: A single query can span multiple models (find a customer's friends (Graph) who watched similar movies (JSON) and gave a five-star rating (Key Value)).
        ◦ Uniform API: Provides easy access for developers using standard SQL and REST for all data types and workloads.
    • This approach does not mean a return to a monolithic architecture. Applications can still be modularized, with each service using a logically separate data container (a Pluggable Database or PDB).
2.1.4 Simplifying Development Paradigms
    • The converged database pairs each modern development methodology with a synergistic data technology to eliminate complexity.
    • Example - Microservices: Oracle simplifies microservices by allowing each service to store its data in an isolated Pluggable Database (PDB), providing the necessary independence and agility within a unified database architecture.
2.1.5 Summary of Benefits
    • Provides synergistic data technologies for modern development.
    • One converged database for all data types and models, engineered to work together.
    • Greatly simplifies both development and operations.


2.2 Oracle Autonomous JSON Database
2.2.1 Core Architecture: Bridging NoSQL and SQL
    • A JSON "collection" is a logical abstraction over a database table.
    • Creating a collection (e.g., "employees") automatically creates a table with a single JSON column to store the documents.
    • Data is stored in OSON, Oracle's optimized binary JSON format.
2.2.2 Document Operations and Their SQL Translation
    • Inserting Data: The insertOne function inserts a JSON document as a row in the backing table via a SQL INSERT statement.
    • Querying Data: The find method uses a filter expression (Query by Example) to select documents.
        ◦ This operation is translated into a SQL SELECT query on the backing table.
    • API Access: The API provides simple put, get, and update operations for JSON objects.
2.2.3 Dual-Mode Access: NoSQL and SQL
    • For Application Developers: The document API offers a simple, non-verbose way to persist data, lowering the barrier to entry.
    • For Data Analysts/Scientists: The backing table remains fully accessible using standard SQL.
    • The database kernel has extensions to natively and efficiently process JSON data via SQL.
2.2.4 Ecosystem and Tooling Compatibility
    • MongoDB Compatibility: Developers familiar with MongoDB can use their existing skills, drivers, and development tools.
    • SQL Tooling: The database works with the vast ecosystem of existing SQL-based tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau) that can connect to Oracle databases.
    • Relational Views: Relational views can be created over JSON collections, allowing traditional BI tools to access the data seamlessly.
2.2.5 Key Benefit
    • Oracle Autonomous JSON Database provides the combined advantages of a document database and a full-featured relational database in a single, converged platform.


2.3 Developing on Oracle Autonomous Database - Using Graph
2.3.1 Graph Database Fundamentals
    • Graph databases explicitly store relationships between data entities, facilitating the discovery and understanding of connections.
    • Vertices: Represent entities (e.g., bank accounts).
    • Edges: Represent the connections or activities between entities (e.g., cash transfers), which can have properties (e.g., amount, date) and a direction.
2.3.2 Business Applications of Graph Analytics
    • Financial Services:
        ◦ Detecting fraud and money laundering by identifying unusual patterns like "distribution and accumulation" and cycles (money returning to its origin account through multiple layers).
    • Manufacturing & Network Management:
        ◦ Performing impact analysis (e.g., the effect of a component design change on assemblies, or a network router failure on connected systems) using path analysis.
    • Recommendation Systems:
        ◦ Identifying customer clusters for product recommendations.
    • Flexible Data Modeling:
        ◦ The flexible schema accommodates products with varying or new attributes easily.

        ◦ Patching the Oracle Grid Infrastructure software.
        ◦ Patching the Oracle Database software on the Database VMs.
        ◦ Updating the operating system on the Database VMs.
3.7.2 Prerequisites and Best Practices for Patching
    • IAM Access: Users must have the appropriate Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to perform maintenance operations.
    • Pre-Patch Best Practices:
        ◦ Backup: Always backup the database before applying any updates.
        ◦ New Database Home: Consider moving the database to a new Database Home instead of updating the existing one.
        ◦ Patch Order: Update the Grid Infrastructure first, as its patch level determines the highest database version the cluster can support.
        ◦ Precheck: Run the precheck operation before the maintenance window to identify and resolve potential issues.
        ◦ System Health: Ensure all servers and database instances are running.
        ◦ Free Space: Ensure /u01 (GI Home) and /u02 (DB Home) each have at least 15 GB of free space.
        ◦ Use OCI Interfaces: Use OCI management interfaces (Console/API) for update operations.
3.7.3 Identifying Current Patch Levels and Available Updates
    • Location: The VM Cluster Details page shows current patch levels for:
        ◦ Exadata Image (includes OS)
        ◦ Grid Infrastructure
        ◦ Database Homes
    • Available Updates: The Updates page lists available patches, organized into three sections:
        ◦ Exadata VM Cluster OS: Contains OS updates.
        ◦ Grid Infrastructure: Shows GI patches or upgrades.
        ◦ Database Home: Lists standard and custom database software images.
    • Update History: The Update History page provides a log of all patching operations (successful or failed) performed via the OCI console/API. It does not show updates applied via command-line tools like dbaascli.
3.7.4 Updating the Guest VM OS (Exadata Image)
    • Process: Automated via the OCI Console or API.
    • Features:
        ◦ Includes a precheck function to validate system readiness.
        ◦ Provides a rollback option in case of issues.
    • Availability: Only the four latest Exadata image minor versions are available for update.

        ◦ Use the Actions menu to either:
            ▪ Run Precheck (recommended first step).
            ▪ Apply the update (this runs a precheck automatically before applying).
3.7.5 Patching the Grid Infrastructure (GI)
    • Process: Also performed via the Updates page or REST API.
    • Procedure:
        1. Select the desired GI patch.
        2. Use the Actions menu to Run Precheck or Apply the patch.
    • Key Consideration: The GI update is performed in a rolling fashion (one node at a time). The database instance on the node being updated will be unavailable during its update cycle.


3.8 Exadata Database Lifecycle Management: User Managed Maintenance Tasks - Part 2
3.8.1 Updating the Oracle Database Home
    • Two Patching Paths:
        1. Update an Existing Database Home: Applies the patch to all databases using that Home.
        2. Move Database to a New Database Home: Creates a new Home with the desired patch level and moves individual databases to it. This is the preferred method as it is faster, less disruptive, and only affects a single database.
    • Update Process (via OCI Console/API):
        1. From the Updates page, select the desired Database Home patch (from a standard or custom image).
        2. Use the Actions menu to Run Precheck (recommended) or Apply the patch (which runs a precheck first).

            ▪ Runs unit tests (e.g., using UTPLSQL).
            ▪ Checks logs for errors.
        ◦ If the pipeline passes, the code can be merged into the main branch.
        ◦ The temporary test environment is destroyed.
        ◦ After a sprint, a new version is tagged and deployed through environments (DEV, UAT, PROD).
7.4.2 Creating Isolated Developer Environments
A critical requirement is providing each developer with an isolated, fresh environment that mirrors the main codebase.
    • Primary Methods for Environment Creation:
        ◦ Autonomous Database (ADB) Clones: Fast and easy cloning via UI, CLI, API, or Terraform.
        ◦ Database VMs: Create from a backup (slower).
        ◦ Exadata Cloud Service: Use sparse cloning for rapid creation.
        ◦ Multitenancy (Pluggable Databases - PDBs): Create PDB clones via:
            ▪ Database APIs
            ▪ ORDS REST APIs
            ▪ Standard SQL scripts
        ◦ Non-Multitenant Databases (Legacy):
            ▪ Guaranteed Restore Points / Flashback Database: Flash the database back to a clean state after each development cycle.
            ▪ RMAN Clones: Using database links.
            ▪ Data Pump: Export/import the schema.
            ▪ ACFS / gDBClone: Using storage snapshots.
7.4.3 Deployment to Production and Rollback Strategies
    • Deployment:
        ◦ Manual: Jenkins creates deployment artifacts (ZIP files); a DBA manually applies them to production. This is common for teams not yet fully trusting automation.
        ◦ Automated: The pipeline automatically deploys the version-tagged code to production environments. This is reliable because the code has been tested repeatedly in identical, cloned environments.
    • Rollback Strategies:
        ◦ Multitenant/PDBs: Rollback the entire PDB to a snapshot.
        ◦ Flashback Database: Revert the entire database to a guaranteed restore point created pre-deployment.
        ◦ Liquibase Rollback: Use Liquibase to roll back specific database object changes.
        ◦ APEX Rollback: Re-install the previous version of the APEX application.
        ◦ Table Flashback: Flashback specific tables to their pre-deployment state.
        ◦ Roll Forward: Fix the issue directly in production and then incorporate that fix back into the main code line.
8. Resiliency
8.1 Database Maximum Security Architecture
8.1.1 Foundational Security Principles
    • Objective: Protect valuable data (intellectual property, financial, personal) from theft and misuse.
    • Core Strategy: A defense-in-depth approach combining multiple technologies. Omitting any single control creates a vulnerability.
    • Key Control Areas:
        1. Assess: Determine the system's current security state and identify risks.
        2. Detect: Identify policy violations and anomalous data access attempts.
        3. Prevent: Block unauthorized access through robust control mechanisms.
8.1.2 Common Database Attack Vectors
    • Compromised Accounts: Targeting administrator or end-user accounts (the most common method).
    • Application Attacks: Exploiting exposed applications as an entry point.
    • Network Sniffing: Intercepting unencrypted data in transit on the internal network.
    • Data File/Backup Theft: Stealing underlying database files, backups, or exports.
    • Unpatched Vulnerabilities: Exploiting known but unaddressed security flaws.
    • Non-Production Systems: Attacking less-secure test/development clones of the production database.
8.1.3 Baseline Security Posture: Core Controls
These controls can be implemented using standard database features, often at no extra cost.
    • 1. System Assessment & Configuration:
        ◦ Goal: Identify insecure configurations, configuration drift, and missing patches.
        ◦ Tools:
            ▪ Database Security Assessment Tool (DBSAT): A free, on-premises utility.
            ▪ OCI Data Safe: A cloud service (included with Oracle Cloud database services) that also provides assessment.
    • 2. Access Control & Authentication:
        ◦ Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure accounts have only the necessary privileges.
        ◦ Privilege Analysis (Enterprise Edition only): Identifies and helps remove unused privileges.
        ◦ Strong Authentication: Implement multi-factor, Kerberos, or PKI certificate-based authentication.
        ◦ Centralized Management: Use Enterprise User Security (Oracle LDAP) or Centrally Managed Users (Microsoft Active Directory).
    • 3. Data Protection:
        ◦ Encryption:
            ▪ Data in Motion: Use Oracle Native Network Encryption or TLS.
            ▪ Data at Rest: Use Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) and protect the encryption keys.
        ◦ Sensitive Data Discovery: Use DBSAT or Data Safe to locate and classify sensitive data (PII, financial data, etc.).
    • 4. Monitoring & Auditing:
        ◦ Database Auditing: Track critical activities such as:
            ▪ Database connections (especially failures).
            ▪ Data Control Language (DCL - user/privilege changes).
            ▪ Data Definition Language (DDL - object creation/modification).
        ◦ Network Monitoring: Monitor SQL traffic for suspicious activity.

8.2 Oracle's Maximum Availability Architecture (MAA)
8.2.1 The Problem: Downtime and Data Loss
    • Impact: Database downtime and data loss have severe financial consequences (e.g., $350k/hour average, up to $10M per outage).
    • Prevalence: 91% of companies experience unplanned data center outages within a two-year period.
8.2.2 Key Terminology and Objectives
    • High Availability (HA): Uses redundant components (like clusters) to ensure service continuity during hardware failures.
    • Scalability: Maintains performance as user load increases.
    • Rolling Updates/Patching: Applies maintenance in a sequential manner to minimize planned downtime.
    • Disaster Recovery (DR): Protects against a complete site outage with a redundant failover site.
    • Key Metrics:
        ◦ Recovery Time Objective (RTO): The target time to restore service after an outage.
        ◦ Recovery Point Objective (RPO): The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time.
8.2.3 The MAA Blueprint and Methodology
    • Definition: Oracle's Maximum Availability Architecture (MAA) is a best practices blueprint for achieving optimal high availability, data protection, and disaster recovery.
    • Development Method: Uses chaos engineering—proactively testing system resilience by simulating failures (network, server, storage, human error, data corruption) to validate failover and recovery processes.
    • Scope: Provides reference architectures for different service levels, covering both engineered and non-engineered systems, on-premises and in the cloud.
8.2.4 Core MAA Technologies and Goals
The architecture uses a suite of technologies to achieve four primary goals:
    1. Data Protection: Minimize data loss using Flashback and Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance.
    2. Active Replication: Enable active-active solutions across sites using Active Data Guard and GoldenGate.
    3. Scale-Out: Linearly scale compute nodes using Real Application Clusters (RAC), Automatic Storage Management (ASM), and Sharding.
    4. Continuous Availability: Enable transparent service failover across local or remote sites using Application Continuity and Global Data Services.
8.2.5 Key Technology Deep Dives
    • Oracle RAC (Real Application Clusters):
        ◦ A clustering technology that eliminates single points of failure by spreading a database across multiple servers.
        ◦ Provides scalability (add nodes without downtime) and protects committed transactions during a node failure.
    • Transparent Application Continuity:
        ◦ A feature of RAC that protects in-flight transactions during an outage.
        ◦ Automatically replays transactions after a failure, making the disruption transparent to the application and end-user.
        ◦ Requires no application changes, only correct driver and connection string configuration.
    • Active Data Guard:
        ◦ The core solution for disaster recovery.
        ◦ Maintains one or more synchronized, physical replicas (standby databases) of the production database.
        ◦ Standby databases are open for read-only access while being synchronized, enabling reporting offload.
        ◦ Enables fast failover (unplanned) and switchover (planned) to minimize downtime.
8.2.6 MAA in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
    • Oracle Database Cloud Service: Offers single instance or RAC deployments, automated backups, and cross-region DR with Active Data Guard.
    • Exadata Cloud Service: Built on Exadata infrastructure for maximum performance and scalability, available as a public cloud service or on-premises via Exadata Cloud@Customer (ExaCC).
    • Autonomous Database: Built on a highly available, multitenant RAC Exadata infrastructure.
        ◦ Autonomous Data Guard: Can be configured with a few clicks for cross-region or cross-availability domain DR.
        ◦ Fully managed by Oracle.
8.2.7 Multicloud Example
    • A Gold MAA architecture can be implemented in a multicloud environment.
    • Example: Oracle Database tier (utilizing RAC and Active Data Guard) in OCI, with the application mid-tier running in a third-party cloud (e.g., AWS, Azure).
    • Network connectivity is provided by partners like Megaport for redundancy.



9. Upgrades and Migrations
9.1 Oracle Database Cloud Migration
9.1.1 Migration Drivers and Service Portfolio
    • Common Reasons for Migration:
        ◦ Upgrading to a new major database version.
        ◦ Moving to new hardware platforms.
        ◦ Re-platforming to the Cloud.
    • Oracle Cloud Database Services: Offer a spectrum of options with varying levels of automation and control to meet different SLA requirements.
9.1.2 Migration Strategies
    • With Downtime: Suitable for applications that can schedule an outage. Opens up simpler migration methods.
    • Zero Downtime / Continuous Operations: Essential for 24/7 applications. Requires more complex migration methods to maintain availability.
9.1.3 Migration Process and Tools
    • General Process: Assess -> Choose Product -> Migrate.
    • Key Tools:
        ◦ Cloud Pre-Migration Advisor Tool (CPAT): Assesses source database compatibility for cloud migration. Now integrated into Data Migration Service (DMS).
        ◦ OCI Database Migration Service (DMS): Focuses on ease of use for zero-downtime migrations.
        ◦ Zero Downtime Migration (ZDM): Offers more fine-grained control and supports migrations to Exadata Cloud@Customer (ExaCC).
        ◦ OCI Application Migration: For moving applications and VMs to the cloud.
        ◦ GoldenGate Veridata: Used for validating data consistency between source and target databases.

9.2 Database Upgrade Best Practices
9.2.1 Pre-Upgrade Preparation
    • Target Release: Oracle Database 19c is the recommended Long Term Support (LTS) release, with premier support until April 2027. Avoid Innovation Releases (like 21c) for production.
    • Performance Stability:
        ◦ SQL Plan Management (SPM): Capture and preserve SQL execution plans before the upgrade to prevent performance regression.
        ◦ Real Application Testing: Use Database Replay to simulate production workload on the upgraded system.
    • Statistics:
        ◦ Gather dictionary and fixed object statistics before upgrading (at least 7 days in advance if using AutoUpgrade) to reduce upgrade time.
        ◦ Fixed Object Stats: Must be gathered after the system is "warmed up" (i.e., running a representative workload), not right after a restart.
9.2.2 The Upgrade Process: Using AutoUpgrade
    • Primary Tool: AutoUpgrade is the strongly recommended tool for all upgrades.
    • Key Features:
        ◦ Automates pre-upgrade checks, the upgrade itself, and post-upgrade tasks.
        ◦ Can upgrade single or multiple databases with one command.
        ◦ Provides detailed logs in multiple formats (TXT, HTML, JSON, XML).
        ◦ Automatically fixes common pre-upgrade issues.
    • Process:
        ◦ Create a simple configuration file specifying source and target details.
        ◦ Run AutoUpgrade -mode ANALYZE to perform pre-upgrade checks.
        ◦ Run AutoUpgrade -mode DEPLOY to execute the upgrade.
9.2.3 Fallback Strategy and COMPATIBLE Parameter
    • Primary Fallback: Use Guaranteed Restore Points and Flashback Database. AutoUpgrade can automate this.
        ◦ Critical: This is only possible before users connect and enter new data after the upgrade (pre "go-live").
    • COMPATIBLE Parameter:
        ◦ When to Change: Raise the COMPATIBLE parameter to the new version (e.g., 19.0.0) 7-10 days after the successful upgrade, during a subsequent maintenance window.
        ◦ Why Wait: Changing COMPATIBLE prevents using Flashback Database or a downgrade for fallback. The delay provides a stabilization period.
        ◦ Value: Always set to the default major release value (e.g., 19.0.0), not a specific Release Update version.
9.2.4 Post-Upgrade Actions
    • Statistics: Do not regather optimizer statistics immediately after the upgrade. Existing statistics are preserved and valid.
    • System Statistics: Generally avoid regathering system stats post-upgrade, as it often causes more problems than it solves.
    • Parameters: Minimize non-default parameters and underscores/events. Use the upgrade project as an opportunity to remove unnecessary ones and move closer to default configurations.
