# Module Intro
I welcome you to this module. In this module, we will begin with foundational machine learning concepts. After that, we will dive into supervised learning, more specifically linear regression and logistic regression. Following that, we will also learn about unsupervised learning. And to end with, we will also explore and learn reinforcement learning. So let's begin.
